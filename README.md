# Find The Wumpus
Written By: Joshua Ciffer & Brian Williams

Our version of Find The Wumpus is a console based game in which a creature called a Wumpus wants to find you and eat your fingers.  Your job 
is to try to defeat the Wumpus in battle.  The player moves around a 2D game board and collects items and tries to find the Wumpus.  The
player can battle the Wumpus alone, or he can find a weapon to help increase his chances of defeating the Wumpus.  Other items include torches
and the compass.  The compass can help locate other items, or the Wumpus.  The torches help the player see what is around him.  This project
demonstrated our knowledge of multi-dimensional arrays and allowed us to use them in a meaningful way.
